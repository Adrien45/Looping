![Loopinp - Make animation loops, but way quicker.](https://github.com/Adrien45/Looping/blob/main/looping_pic.png)

## Description

Looping is an After Effects plugin that simplifies creating seamless loops in animations. It allows users to easily apply looping expressions to either time remapping or keyframed properties on selected layers. With options to choose between different loop types and a clear-all feature for removing loop expressions, Looping streamlines repetitive animation workflows for motion designers and animators.
